                <h4>Redesigning an ad for the Modern Age</h4>
                <p>For this project, I chose <a
                        href="https://collections.artsmia.org/art/40356/adler-typewriter-lucian-bernhard"> Lucian
                        Bernhard’s </a> poster for Adler typewriters from 1908 as I was amazed by its balance of
                    saturated colors and object space that made it as popular, defined his Sachplakat style. The
                    beautiful shades of purples of the typewriter and the font of the Adler logo on the orange
                    background were so striking to me that I wanted to make a modern-day version of it with a laptop
                    computer, green and yellow coloring, and my last name to replace the Adler title. With adobe
                    illustrator, I tried to recreate the beautiful lines of Bernhard’s piece but wanted to use crisp and
                    clean lines instead. For the colors, I chose green and yellow as I felt they would be an interesting
                    contrast to Bernhard’s purple and orange. With this bookplate, my design was very much based on my
                    own subjective ideas and concepts instead of following the original purpose of the Adler poster and
                    advertising a product. </p>
