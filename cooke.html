                <h3>Darwyn Cooke Tribute</h3>
                <h4>A memorial for a legendary artist and writer</h4>
                <p>I designed a collage to pay tribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwyn_Cooke">Darwyn
                        Cooke </a>, the artist and creator of many groundbreaking graphic novel stories such as The New
                    Frontier and Parker. I chose to incorporate his most popular pieces not only because they would be
                    more recognizable to the general audience but also because they would help give the collage a theme.
                    For this project, my main goal was to emphasize how much Cooke redefined DC comics and its many
                    amazing characters, represented by all the characters in the collage coming from the self-portrait
                    of Cooke in the bottom left corner.</p>
