            <h3>Music Animation</h3>
            <h4>Following the Sounds</h4>
            <p>Using the song "Going Higher" by Ben Sound, the main sphere in the animation follows the rhythm of the Guitar notes, bouncing from side to side and moving towards the screen with the height and distance of the bounces based on the pitch of the notes, as lower notes create small bounces while high notes create larger bounces. As a light follows the bouncing ball in a theater show fashion, a second light turns on in the back, shining on a cylinder hitting the bass drum notes. Since the song has both cymbal and bass drum notes, I tried to have the cylinder follow both sounds: the cylinder hitting the surface marked bass notes while the uplift marks some of the cymbal tones. For the video's environment, I created a small concert hall with the side walls slanted to allow the drum cylinder to hit it and for the sphere to bounce off of in interesting ways. For the shader, I gave the cylinder a wood shader to mimic the look of a real drum stick while the sphere had a gray lambert shader, like a rubber ball. For the surfaces, I added a granite shader to give it a lighter tone against the pitch black backgrounds. </p>
