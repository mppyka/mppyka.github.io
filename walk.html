            <h3>Walking Animation</h3>
            <h4>Capturing Sadness and Happiness</h4>
            <p>For this animation, I originally planned to portray the walk of an older person, emphasizing the back strain, slow leg movement and the stance of the arms, until I realized it could be modified to mirror the movement of an injured adventurer, based on the character of Nathan Drake from the Uncharted video game series (as seen in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kYF0w06Wbc&t=535s after 8:37). The idea is that the otherall walk would be stilted and slow to resemble the stamber of a wounded character. For the actual footsteps, I emphasize the weight and weakness of the character by making the movements feel uneasy and sudden, having the heel-lifts be slow and low before quickly landing on the floor again, with the pelvis turning slightly with the movements of the legs. For the hand movements, I had the character hold their left side as if they were keeping pressure on a wound, while the other hand kept a distance forward to look like they were trying to find their way by trying to grab at whatever is in front of them. While the character stammers forward, I have them bend and strench their back to symbolize the spasms of their muscles as they try to stay strong and survive. I also have the character turn their head from side to side, as it follows the bends and lifts of their shoulder, to highlight the confusion and weariness in their walk as they look everywhere to find their way and allow their back to control most of their head turns. After playing with the speed of the character, I created 2 versions of the animatic: a regular, quicker walk and a slow-motion walk. I kept both versions as I wasn't sure which felt more realistic and/or entertaining. The character models were created by my college professor Micheal Neff.</p>
